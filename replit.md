# Replit Project Documentation

## Overview

This is a minimal web development project configured for Replit with a simple Python HTTP server setup. The project is designed to serve static web content using Python's built-in HTTP server module on port 5000.

## System Architecture

The project follows a simple static web server architecture:

- **Runtime Environment**: Node.js 20 and Python 3.11 dual-language support
- **Web Server**: Python's built-in `http.server` module
- **Port Configuration**: Internal port 5000 mapped to external port 80
- **Deployment**: Replit-native hosting with automatic workflows

## Key Components

### Server Configuration
- **Technology**: Python HTTP server (`python -m http.server`)
- **Port**: 5000 (internal) â†’ 80 (external)
- **Purpose**: Serves static files from the project directory

### Development Environment
- **Primary Runtime**: Python 3.11 for server functionality
- **Secondary Runtime**: Node.js 20 (available for future frontend tooling)
- **Nix Channel**: stable-24_05 for consistent package management

### Workflow Management
- **Run Strategy**: Parallel workflow execution
- **Auto-start**: Server automatically starts when project runs
- **Port Forwarding**: Automatic external access configuration

## Data Flow

1. User requests are received on external port 80
2. Replit forwards requests to internal port 5000
3. Python HTTP server serves static files from project root
4. Responses are returned directly to the client

## External Dependencies

### Runtime Dependencies
- Python 3.11 (provided by Replit Nix environment)
- Node.js 20 (available but not actively used)

### Infrastructure Dependencies
- Replit hosting platform
- Nix package manager (stable-24_05 channel)

## Deployment Strategy

### Local Development
- Uses Replit's integrated development environment
- Automatic server restart on file changes
- Live preview through port forwarding

### Production Deployment
- Replit handles hosting automatically
- No additional deployment configuration required
- External access through port 80 mapping

### Scalability Considerations
- Current setup suitable for development and small-scale static sites
- Python HTTP server is not production-grade for high-traffic applications
- Future scaling would require migration to production web server (nginx, Apache, etc.)

## User Preferences

```
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
```

## Development Notes

### Current Limitations
- Basic static file serving only
- No database integration
- No authentication mechanisms
- Single-threaded server performance

### Future Enhancement Opportunities
- Add frontend framework integration (utilizing Node.js runtime)
- Implement backend API with Flask/FastAPI
- Add database integration (PostgreSQL recommended)
- Implement proper production web server configuration

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Add HTML/CSS/JavaScript files to project root
2. Consider adding package.json for Node.js dependencies
3. Implement proper error handling and logging
4. Add environment-specific configurations
